The models aim to predict whether a bicycle will be recovered or not given different combinations of data. 

  For this project, we are presented with bicycle theft data from the City of Toronto. The dataset contains details of offences wherein a bicycle theft is included, the date when the theft occurred and reported, the location details, and the bicycle information. Using these features, the members of the group were able to train several models with new data. These models were the Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.  

  The models aim to predict whether a bicycle will be recovered or not given different combinations of data. Using the feature selection technique of chi-square, we were able to determine which features we are going to keep for the model training. Also, as the data is imbalanced between the recovered and unrecovered classes, the technique of up-sampling has been applied. Lastly, a grid search was used to determine the best parameters for each of the models and the training dataset.
